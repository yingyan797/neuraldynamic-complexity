--- Computational Neurodynamics (COMP70100) ---

Part of the solution to Questions 1 and 2 in Exercise 2. This class can
simulate a network Izhikevich neurons with arbitrary parameters,
connectivities, and conduction delays. See docstrings of the methods and the
class itself for more information. Read through the comments in the code to
understand what it does.

Thanks to Paul Vanhaesebrouck for bug-hunting.

  """
  This class is used to simulate a network of Izhikevich neurons. The state of
  the neurons is automatically initialised, and parameters and connectivity
  matrices can be set with the appropriate setter methods. All class members are
  hidden (i.e. underscored) except for the state of the neurons (v,u).
  
  For both the delay and weight connectivity matrices, A[i,j] refers to the
  connection from neuron i to j. This was done this way (against standard
  convention) because the algorithm is easier to vectorise this way.
  
  Vectorisation with inhomogeneous time-delays is accomplished via a cylindrical
  accumulator array X, that is updated at every time step. More details in the
  inline comments.
